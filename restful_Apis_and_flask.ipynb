        "- A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a type of API that follows the principles of REST architecture. Here's a breakdown:\n",
        "- Stateless: The server doesn't store information about the client's state between requests. Each request contains all the information needed to process it.\n",
        "-  Client-Server Architecture: There's a clear separation of concerns between the client (requesting the data) and the server (providing the data).\n",
        "- Layered System: Intermediaries like load balancers and proxies can be placed between the client and server without affecting the client's interaction.\n",
        "Uniform Interface: The API uses a consistent and standardized way to interact with resources, typically using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).\n",

        "Easy to Integrate: Flask integrates well with other libraries and technologies, making it suitable for building APIs that interact with various data sources, databases, and services.\n",
        "- Scalability: While Flask itself is lightweight, it can be scaled to handle high traffic loads by using appropriate deployment strategies and tools.\n",

        "\n",
        "Here's a short explanation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Define the Route:** Use the `@app.route()` decorator to define the URL endpoint that will handle POST requests. Crucially, you need to specify `methods=['POST']` (or include `'POST'` if allowing multiple methods like `['GET', 'POST']`).\n",
        "2.  **Access Request Data:** Inside the view function associated with the POST route, you access the data sent in the request body using the `request` object.\n",
        "    *   For form data (e.g., from an HTML form with `method=\"post\"` and default `enctype`), use `request.form`. This is a dictionary-like object.\n",

For successful creation of a resource, it's common to return a 201 Created status code and potentially the newly created resource's data using `jsonify()`. If there's an error (e.g., invalid data), return an appropriate error status code (like 400 Bad Request) and an error message.\n"

        "*   **Authorization:** Determine if the authenticated client has permission to perform the requested action on the requested resource. This involves defining roles and permissions and checking them in your view functions.\n",
        "*   **HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS to encrypt communication between the client and the API, protecting data in transit from eavesdropping and tampering. Obtain an SSL/TLS certificate for your server.\n",
        "*   **Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate all incoming data from the client to prevent injection attacks (like SQL injection or cross-site scripting). Use libraries like Marshmallow or Pydantic for data validation.\n",
        "*   **Rate Limiting:** Limit the number of requests a client can make within a certain time frame to prevent abuse, denial-of-service attacks, and brute-force attacks. Flask-Limiter is a useful extension for this.\n",
        "*   **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):** Properly configure CORS headers to control which origins (domains) are allowed to access your API, preventing unauthorized cross-origin requests. Use the Flask-CORS extension.\n",
        "*   **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling that avoids revealing sensitive information in error responses. Return generic error messages and log detailed errors on the server side.\n",
        "*   **Regular Security Updates and Monitoring:** Keep Flask, its extensions, and all dependencies updated to patch vulnerabilities. Monitor your API for suspicious activity.\n",
